### Briefly About Myself:
-------
Having started my career as an English tutor and have been working for about 10 years. Remote work as a tutor gives me extra free time, which I can spend on learning Frontend Development. However, I want to develop further,
 and that’s how Frontend development came into my life. I want to further develop in the IT field, and
 knowledge of English helps a lot with this.

 I am a member of the IT community. I learned Frontend with an experienced mentor, and consolidated my knowledge on
 practice. I also have experience of working with a team. And I took part in an ITGirlschool internship.

 I’m keen on Web Development because this occupation gives you a lot of possibilities in your career growth and stability.

 I'm sure that my purposefulness will help me to become a highly qualified specialist in this field.
